Important! Run "sudo pacman -Syy" before trying to use pacman. 
It's a good idea to run "pacaur -Syu" to update packages including AUR.

To install codecs: "sudo pacman -S gstreamer0.10-plugins"
To install Flash: "sudo pacman -S flashplugin"
To install official Java runtime: "pacaur -S jre"

You may have to restart your applications or computer.

Languages other than English are now handled automatically through
the installer.

Proprietary GPU drivers:

To install the current NVIDIA proprietary driver:

sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
Reboot to allow the automatic configuration by the package
sudo nvidia-xconfig
Reboot a last time to restart the X server with the new settings

To install the current ATI/AMD proprietary driver:

pacaur -S catalyst-total # If you're using a pre-5xxx card, use catalyst-total-hd234k instead
sudo aticonfig --initial
Reboot to restart the X server with the new settings
